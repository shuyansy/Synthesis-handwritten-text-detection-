# Synthesis multilingual handwritten text data
Detecting multilingual handwritten texts in the document is demanding due to the lack of training data. Therefore, we designed a simple yet effective method focused on multilingual handwritten text dataset generation that is beneficial for handwritten text detection and segmentation.

## Installation

### Download source document data from [XFUND](https://github.com/doc-analysis/XFUND) 
### Download multilingual handwritten recognition data from [](https://github.com/doc-analysis/XFUND) 



### run a demo script for handwritten texts generation.(50% printed data will be replaced by handwritten one, and the results will be recorded in coco-style annotation)

```python Funsd.py```
